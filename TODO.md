Research:
  - [ ] Prague 2024 hackathon - see the (fiat) exchange combo.
  - [ ] Protocol with a beneficiary (during execution): Check if it is ready/alive (e.g., send a small amount of tokens with a message - "please send something back". If successful, send the remaining sum).
  - [ ] License.
  - [ ] Print `get_transactions`: `(GetTransactionsRequest) -> (GetTransactionsResponse)` query; after approval, transfer - after everything that returns `BlockIndex`.
    - // mtlk todo
    - The following method is marked as 'update' because it internally performs an inter-canister call.
    - Consider performing the balance retrieval from the frontend?
    - `"get_balance" : () -> (ResultNat);`
  - [ ] Consider all as a plugin into a larger app (a wallet?).
  - [ ] Perhaps a wallet can be connectable. Can it give delegation?
  - [ ] How costly are the timers?
  - [ ] Debuggable frontend and backend.
  - [ ] Who pays for transaction and approval fees - inheritors? - To decide. Option.
  - [ ] Notifications - websocket?
  - [ ] How to handle roles: the beneficiary should not immediately become the testator ðŸ˜ƒ.
  - [ ] Frontend: Button register as default (pressing Enter).

Features:
  - [ ] Show account-id in GUI, next to the Principal.
  - [ ] Refreshing.
  - [ ] Polling - ok. Only update buttons if the timer is gone. Eventually, check the transfer info obtained as the beneficiary (balance).
  - [ ] Send - message - notification on the recipient's side.
  - [ ] Toast or snack when timer execution is successful or not.
  - [ ] Frontend - react to all data (beneficiaries) after `getUser`.
  - [ ] Canceling timers, reinstantiating - may fail - handle it and test.
  - [ ] Frontend - show version.
  - [ ] Frontend - e8 precision.
  - [ ] Frontend - show principal along with nickname in the select beneficiary dropdown list box.
  - [ ] Frontend - display information about the remaining time and execution date.
  - [ ] Frontend - show token balance (asterisk*** mode).
  - [ ] Send an invite to the app to be a beneficiary or testator.
  - [ ] Dockerfile with versions, Dockerfile - print current versions - insert them into Dockerfile.
  - [ ] Is the beneficiary ready? - small amounts protocol.
  - [ ] Bitcoin.
  - [ ] Back to branch main.
  - [ ] Upgrades of canister - hook - use hooks for upgrade first.

Tests:
  - e2e:
    - [ ] A test for `after_inactivity`.
    - [ ] A test for `inactivity_period`.
    - [ ] A test for the timer.
  - [ ] Unit.
  - [ ] System.

Defects:
  - [ ] `identityToUse` - not needed.
  - [ ] Why is the beneficiary ICP count not displayed after refresh?
  - [ ] Frontend - not finding back when the same user is selected.
  - [ ] Dockerfile - `nvm` what for?
  - [ ] In the `sleepy` test. `Timy`. Refactor to have more descriptive functions. For each window, include an object with a nickname and how much money it should allocate instead of vectors [0.1400,1500]. Remove debugging `savepage`.
  - [ ] How to name the identity that is giving money for nothing (instead of Alice).

DONE:
  - [x] DRY `setUserData`.
  - [x] Perhaps not polling. Use a one-shot timer in the GUI?
  - [x] Update balance as well.
  - [x] Run the test on the real system.
  - [x] React bug - move (before `inactivity_period`):
    - `await announceActivity(identity)`.
    - `await getUserData()`.
    - `await getAllUsers()`.
  - [x] Use effect `[principal]`.
  - [x] `git stash save cleanup_inactivity_period done`, switch to fixes, and do it.
  - [x] After inactivity: Condition on `x` of inactivity.
  - [x] Frontend - grey save, show Cancel.
  - [x] Test - Selenium, create 3 II.
  - [x] Logged in as: display principal and nickname.
  - [x] Save log session.
  - [x] Send - message.
  - [x] `nvm` use 20 for `build.sh`.
  - [x] Send - token.
  - [x] Send token delayed.
  - [x] Block funds for the transaction.
  - [x] Batch transaction.
  - [x] Send to an external address.
  - [x] Bug with balance.
  - [x] Connect cancel action.
  - [x] Selenium - //TODO(mtlk) - a more sophisticated wait here.
